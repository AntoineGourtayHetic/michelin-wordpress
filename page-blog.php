				<h2>Bluetooth: it is flying!</h2>
				<p>It is now time to update you about where we stand with regards to the communication link between the smartphone and the drone. Technically, the solution widely used today is telemetry dongles at different frequency bands depending on the country you are located (433MHz, 868MHz or 915Mhz). This however requires to have an additional piece of hardware connected on the smartphone. This is why we have investigated an other solution to have a direct connection with the drone without additionnal piece of hardware: Bluetooth.</p>

				<h2>Let the show begin</h2>
				<p>Here we are, D-Day has come and we’re ready to face the most tech savvy and hot products hunters present at the CES. All the consumer electronics products that will be hot in 2015 are at CES and we gotta stand out. I’ve been going to CES for 6 years and always get very excited to confront what we’ve been developing and get feedback from future customers, users, press, investors, all in one place, it’s a great place to learn about your audience and get instant feedback on their needs, what’s cool ,what’s not.</p>
